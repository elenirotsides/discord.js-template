# Discord.js Bot Template for ES modules

I modified the original template from MenuDocs for use in ES modules. You can find the original template I based this one off of by going to the original repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/MenuDocs/discord.js-template)!

Special thanks to MenuDocs for the inspiration! Their template saved me a lot of time and made structuring the code much easier!
